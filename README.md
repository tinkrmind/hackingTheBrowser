### [Homework](https://codepen.io/tinkrmind/pen/BxozGz)

I was making a bookmarklet to delete prices from items on Amazon. While experimenting with it, I realized that I had created an infinite loop of console.log, which made the page completely unresponsive. Since the aim was to make a bookmarklet that works against the user, I figured my job is done!

*Warning*: A few times this made Chrome unresponsive to the point where I could not even close the tab. So I had to close Chrome from the Activity Monitor. If you have any important tabs open, I'd suggest you not to try it.

[When the cat is away](https://codepen.io/tinkrmind/pen/yKqpeJ) is a webpage that behaves differently when you're around vs when you're away. It uses the webcam to detect faces, and when no one is around, it reveals a secret. I was influenced by the in class demos of webpages behaving differently when they're off focus. And there's some influence from toy story as well.
