# Week 2

[When the cat is away](https://codepen.io/tinkrmind/pen/yKqpeJ) is a webpage that behaves differently when you're around vs when you're away. It uses the webcam to detect faces, and when no one is around, it reveals a secret. I was influenced by the in class demos of webpages behaving differently when they're off focus. And there's some influence from toy story as well.

# Week 1

[Homework](https://codepen.io/tinkrmind/pen/yKpXov): Toggles the background color of a HTML document between yellow and a random color when a button is pressed.
